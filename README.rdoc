## Assingment
This was an assingment for Code Fellows Ruby Dev Accelerator which was:
"Create a collaborative question-and-answer style site. Allow users to register and sign in. Allow users to view all questions and answers in the site, and edit field they like (eg: no authorization restrictions needed). Each question only needs one answer, so you should use a single Question resource, that has an answer attribute, rather than associating with answer resource (I repeat: do NOT create an answer resource). Scaffolding is fine. The key feature of this app is that it will track all who is editing what. Each question will show a list of contributors, and each author's page should show the q/a that they've edited.Since one user can edit many different questions, and any given question can be edited by many/any users, use a has_and_belongs_to_many" A blog post that helped complete this was found at: http://shilpi2189.blogspot.com/2013/01/implementing-hasandbelongstomany.html
